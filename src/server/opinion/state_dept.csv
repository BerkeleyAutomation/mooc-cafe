I would talk about this because there is a structural problem within Pakistani politics the implications of which the U.S. has not fully come to terms with.

If peace prevailed in Kashmir and Waziristan and economic development followed,  then of what use would the army and ISI be? America needs to appreciate this much more powerful paradigm and shape its engagement with Pakistan accordingly.

Unipolar power is no more, and attempting to address present problems through outdated understandings of international relations creats more resistance than solves problems. My specific suggestion is to re-engage in international organizations. Historically, during periods of increased global cooperation, the US was able to benifit most not by resisting, but by placing itself in the middle of the process and building international organizations around values and interests which reflect the position of the US.

I believe the key to more positive interaction with the people of third world countries in particular would be if the general populations of those nations had more tools to better resist misinformation and be more actively involved in the politics of their regions. For the US this means spending money on willing nations first to aid with this idea of improving access to education while also using diplomacy against governments who purposely  divert state funds away from education. I also think that the idea of more open and transparent US government will aid in giving more of an idea about how and why the US acts the way it does on the world stage.

Why there is no difference between a PhD student and bacholar student? Was there any threat from Iranian student in US that they have to get one entry visa?

Without conflict, there would be no use for weapons of any kind.  In an ideal world, the international community would promote world peace through diplomacy.  Since lack of resources (i.e. food, clean water, adequate medical supplies, agriculture equipment, education, etc.) is the root cause of most conflict, these diplomatic actions would include providing the most needy countries with these basic resources.  However, it is not an ideal world.  I don't think this is the whole solution -- it is only a piece of the puzzle.  The international community would also be wise to explain why nuclear proliferation is ultimately bad for everyone, including those countries that seek to deploy nuclear weapons.

We were able to determine the Soviet's bomber and missile numbers due to President Eisenhower's willingness to push the bounds in overhead reconnaissance.  A similar paradym is needed for today's verification of nuclear non-proliferation (whether that be via human intelligence, network exploitation, etc).  Also, there has to be a credible threat of response by the U.S.  Most Asian and middle eastern cultures have a respect for strength and won't believe or give credence to a seeminly week opponent.  Continuing the U.S.'s current apparent diplomatic track of downplaying U.S. strengths and attempting to mollify opponents hurts us in the long term and is exactly the wrong plan.  Speaking softly has its time and place but giving away the big stick is a serious miscalculation and a long term self defeating strategy.Best Regards,MarkAurora, Colorado",0,0,0.685082872928,0.988950276243,0.0276243093923,0.243093922652,0.690607734807,1,1,22,23,
