Please save this link.  You can use it anytime to view updates on the
data collected so far to check your "Participation Score", which 
increases as you grade the issues others have suggested (100 points 
for each up to 10,000 points), and when others grade the issue you 
suggested (up to 30,000 points). Participants with the highest scores 
will be eligible to be invited to meet with Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, 
Professor Ken Goldberg, and the CRC team at UC Berkeley on 
20 March 2014 to discuss the data and lessons learned from version 
1.0 and the most important issues for version 2.0.

Thanks again for participating!
