I'm not quite sure what it is but scribbling down ideas in another notebook or on your computer is not the same experience as using a design notebook. Part of my strong feelings for having a design notebook stems from the fact that most designs shown off today are final, polished products however I think that this is only one component of design. I think the messier parts, where solutions fail, is just as an important part of the design process.
